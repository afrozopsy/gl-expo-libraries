# gl-expo-libraries
Compilation of all up-to-date GL related libraries for react-native expo SDK.

## Usage

Download the tarbar and copy the contents in your project.
The you can import like, `import { GLImage , Surface } from gl-expo-libraries;`

* I haven't created a package coz I thought it can make conflict with your downloaded(node_modules) libraries.

## SideNote,

Sole purpose of this repo is to make sure gl implementation of expo never breaks,
if you see changes that you think will make improvements then feel free to drop
a PR.
